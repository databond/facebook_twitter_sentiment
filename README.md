# Twitter_Facebook_sentiment_Analysis
This code allows you to connect into Facebook and Twitter in order to retreive content and analyse sentiments

##Credit
Originally, Twitter part is forked from Sirajology amazing work. I added the Facebook part as part of this challenge: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_OZdbCzHUA

##Dependencies

* tweepy (http://www.tweepy.org/)
* textblob (https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/)

Install missing dependencies using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)

##Usage

Once you have your dependencies installed via pip, run the script in terminal via

```
python demo.py
```

##Challenge

Instead of printing out each tweet, save each Tweet to a CSV file with an associated label. The label should be either 'Positive' or 'Negative'. You can define the sentiment polarity threshold yourself, whatever you think constitutes a tweet being positive/negative. Push your code repository to [github](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) then post it in the comments. I'll give the winner a shoutout a week from now!

##Credits

This code is 100% Siraj baby.
